        <p>For this final project, I explored a cars dataset. The data had 262 observations with cars' MPG, cylinders, 
		cubic inches of a cylinder, horsepower, weight (in pounds), year, and region (US, Japan, Europe). 
		Below are two visualizations that dive into the relationships between horsepower and MPG.</p>

        <h2>Scatter Plot</h2>
        <a href="Scatterplot.html">Scatter Plot</a>

        <h2>Bar Graph</h2>
        <a href="Bar_Graph.html">Bar Graph</a>

	<h2> Conclusion </h2>
	  <p> From the scatterplot, we discover that there is a negative relationship between horsepower and mpg. This seems 
	reasonable as the more power a car needs to move, the more gas will be consumed. We can also see that the US in general
	has higher horsepower vehicles which led to them also having less fuel-efficient vehicles. The opposite can be said in Japan. 
	Their cars in general had more mpg but less horsepower. The European cars are not too far from Japan as they had 3 of the 4 
	most fuel-efficient cars, but the most fuel-efficient car was Japanese and also had more horsepower than the 3. In terms of
	fuel efficiency Japan is the most successful having an average of 30.21 mpg, while the US expectdly had the least with 19.63 mpg.
