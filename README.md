# Visualizing Info Final Project
The goal of the final project is to give you hands-on experience in designing and implementing interactive visualizations using D3. We will learn how to import data, parse it, and clean it up using JavaScript. We'll then visualize this data using common charts: bar charts, line charts, scatterplots, etc... Your task is to design and implement an interactive visualization in D3 to facilitate the exploration of your chosen dataset.
